Feautures Included:

- Microphone – Allowed the use of a microphone to used if enabled.

- Beat Detection - Using beat detection by looking into Root Mean Square – which is
  Measuring the Amplitude to detect for changes in the beats.
  
- Wave Patterns – Using waveform() to be able to create waves and also implementing
beginShape and mapping to show the change through a period of time.

play when clicked.

the Music Application.

- Menu - Menu which allows you to change between visuals by using arrays to store each
visual in them and the use of constructor functions.

- Sound Length Visuals - The user can see at which point they are in the song as I used
currentTime() which gave me the current time of the sound in seconds and also duration
which gave me the duration of the song and through mapping I was allowing to display
this visually.
